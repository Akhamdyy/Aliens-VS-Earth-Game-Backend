Alien Invasion: Battle Simulation1. Project OverviewThis project is a C++ Object-Oriented simulation engine designed to model a battlefield conflict between an Earth Army and an Alien Army. The simulation operates in discrete time steps, generating units based on probabilistic inputs and managing them using custom-built Abstract Data Types (ADTs).The primary goal of the application is to simulate unit generation, storage in specific data structures based on unit type, and eventually combat logic (Phase 1 currently covers generation and storage).2. Army Architecture & Unit TypesThe simulation distinguishes between two armies, each containing three specific unit types. Each unit type is managed by a distinct Data Structure chosen to represent its behavior on the battlefield.All units inherit from the abstract base class Unit.🌍 Earth ArmyUnit TypeClassDescriptionData StructureLogic & SourceEarth SoldierESStandard InfantryLinkedQueueDeployed in FIFO (First-In, First-Out) order11.Earth TankETHeavy ArmorArrayStackMaintained in LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) order; newest tanks deploy first22.Earth GunnerEGHigh DamagepriQueuePriority Queue.

Custom Data Structures (ADTs)The project implements template-based Data Structures from scratch to manage the units.LinkedQueue: A standard Queue implementation using a linked list (FIFO)77.ArrayStack: A Stack implementation using a static array (LIFO)8.DoubleQueue: A unique linked-list queue supporting a Doubledequeue operation. This allows the system to remove/deploy units from both the front and the back of the queue simultaneously (specifically for Alien Drones)9.priQueue: A Priority Queue implemented as a sorted linked list.Implementation: Uses priNode which stores a priority integer. The enqueue method uses insertion sort logic to place high-priority nodes at the head.ArrayPointers: A custom container managing a dynamic array of pointers, specifically designed for AM units10101010.4. Simulation Flow & InputRandom Generation (RandGen)The RandGen class handles the creation of units based on configuration:Probability Check: A global probability (prob) determines if any unit is generated at a specific timestep.Type Selection: If generation occurs, random percentages determine if the unit is a Soldier, Tank/Monster, or Gunner/Drone.Stat Randomization: Health, Power, and Attack Capacity are randomized within min/max ranges provided in the input file.Input File FormatThe Game::ReadInput function parses a text file to configure the simulation. The expected format is11:PlaintextN // Simulation Parameter (Count)
ES% ET% EG% // Earth Unit Percentages
AS% AM% AD% // Alien Unit Percentages
Prob // Probability of generation per timestep
MinP MaxP MinH MaxH MinC MaxC // Earth Ranges: Power, Health, Capacity
